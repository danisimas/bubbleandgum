**About the Game**  

**Title:** Bubble & Gum 

Step into the vibrant world of **Bolhopolis** and join **Bubble** and **Gum** on an exciting journey full of puzzles, challenges, and fun! This 2D puzzle-platformer demands creativity and teamwork to overcome obstacles and explore levels brimming with surprises.  

**Bubble** is an energetic and optimistic bolhobo! Thanks to her lightweight body, she falls slower than Gum and can create floating bubbles in mid-air. These bubbles not only help with traversal but also serve as platforms for other characters, adding a unique cooperative mechanic to the game.  

**Gum**, or **Jaime Gummy**, is Bubble’s gummy sidekick and a master of adaptability. With his flexible and moldable body, Gum can split into two, leaving a piece of gum on the ground that works as a platform for other characters. His ability to shrink in size also makes him perfect for squeezing through tight spaces and solving specific puzzles.
